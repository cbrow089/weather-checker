  ## Installation
  * This is a backend system using express.js and node.  I utilizes several npm packages that must be intstalled for this to run locally such as axios, dotenv, fs, path, and uuidv4.  This application is also deployed via Render and will be hosted and live for users to access at the link below.
    
  ## Usage
  A user inputs a city name and the backend linked code will make an API call to openweather.org and generate a list of data that is then parsed into the correct format to display on the applications main page.  The current weather for the date and city will be displayed at the top and the five day forecast will be displayed in card style under the box displaying the current weather for the selected city.
